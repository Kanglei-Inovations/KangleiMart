UI Design
The user interface (UI) design is a crucial part of the shopping app. Here's a brief description of the main screens and their components:

Home Screen

AppBar: Contains the app logo and a search bar.
Category List: Horizontal list of product categories.
Product Grid: Grid view displaying products.
Product Details Screen

Product Image: Large image of the product.
Product Info: Name, price, description, and rating.
Add to Cart Button: Button to add the product to the cart.
Cart Screen

Cart Items: List of items added to the cart.
Total Price: Displays the total price of items in the cart.
Checkout Button: Button to proceed to checkout.
Order Screen

Order Summary: List of ordered items with order details.
Order Status: Display the status of the order (e.g., processing, shipped, delivered).
Authentication Screens

Login Screen: Fields for email and password, login button, and link to the signup screen.
Signup Screen: Fields for name, email, password, and signup button.
Controller and State Management
For state management, you can use the Provider package, which is well-suited for managing the state of the app efficiently.

Example: Products Provider (products_provider.dart)
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import '../models/product.dart';
import '../services/api_service.dart';

class ProductsProvider with ChangeNotifier {
List<Product> _products = [];

List<Product> get products {
return [..._products];
}

Future<void> fetchProducts() async {
try {
_products = await ApiService.getProducts();
notifyListeners();
} catch (error) {
throw error;
}
}

Product findById(String id) {
return _products.firstWhere((prod) => prod.id == id);
}
}
Example: Product Model (product.dart)
class Product {
final String id;
final String title;
final String description;
final double price;
final String imageUrl;

Product({
required this.id,
required this.title,
required this.description,
required this.price,
required this.imageUrl,
});
}
Conclusion
This is a high-level overview to get you started on creating an online shopping app like KangleiMart using Flutter.
You'll need to implement the UI components, models, providers, and services according to your specific requirements and design 
preferences.
